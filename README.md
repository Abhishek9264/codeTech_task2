**OverView of Project**

**Breast Cancer Classification Project**
**Overview**
This project demonstrates a comparative analysis of various machine learning models for breast cancer classification using the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to classify whether the cancer is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from cell nuclei present in the image.

**Project Structure**

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Create a DataFrame with the feature data and target labels.
Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and check for missing values.
Standardize the features using StandardScaler.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train and evaluate four different models:
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Evaluate each model using accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, and classification_report.
Visualize the performance metrics for all models using bar plots.
